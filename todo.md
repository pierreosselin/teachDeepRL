TODO (Not primordial):
- Z dimension not hard coded
- Size test set not hard coded

TODO today:
- Check NN weights, I am even learning anything?:
    - Check loss on single environment
    - Change environment and check result on previous environment

        - Log pi loss v loss gif policy on one environment gif second environment, gif first environment again


- Check loss function for one same environment, use wandb for this.

- Explore Multiprocessing in the training loop

TODO if time:
- Work on visualization Latent Space

- Hypothesis testing:
    - GAN multimodal via interpolation
