- Setup visualization
    - Latent space representation


- Check Gan Latent Space Gives modes of environments

- Check if uses GPU

- Put on AIMS server

Implementation details:
- Correct setup for number of tests
- Gif for first test example
- Correct setup for data loading


TODO Today:
- SPend some tume understanding why gpu utils so low (parallel?)

- Make sure test set works on small experiments

- Run policy on several benchmark overnight
