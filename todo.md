- Setup visualization
    - Latent space representation

- Check Gan Latent Space Gives modes of environments

- SPend some tume understanding why gpu utils so low (parallel?)

- Make sure test set works on small experiments


- Plot KL divergence
- Plot ALP-GMM Visualization
- Look failed mazes (0 average reward)
- Check GPU
- Difference maze looks (make gif sequential mazes)
- Why random better than alp
- Train test set optimal policy, number of steps required (ex bfs) + order in difficulty
- Exploration -> sparse reward




Main components:
- Visualization:
    - Latent Space GMM
    - Plot KL Divergence

- Hypothesis testing:
    - GAN multimodal

TODO:
- Z dimension not hard coded
- Size test set not hard coded



- ALP-GMM visualization
- Computing max reward per mazes to normalize, reward random agent?
- Check out why always same seed
