WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/pierre/miniconda3/envs/teachDRL/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/dispatch.py:206: multinomial (from tensorflow.python.ops.random_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.random.categorical` instead.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/pierre/Git/teachDeepRL/teachDRL/spinup/utils/mpi_tf.py:64: py_func (from tensorflow.python.ops.script_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.
